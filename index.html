            <h2>Here is the MOTHER TERESA's journey</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong> Her birth and Early Life </strong> </li>
                  <p> Mother Teresa was born on 26 August 1910. Her birthplace was Skopje, which is now the capital of the Republic of Macedonia. She was an Albanian-Indian Roman Catholic nun and missionary (who travel from one place to another in the propagation of religion).
                  </p>
                <br>
                <li><strong> A Compassionate Heart </strong> </li>
                  <p> Mother Teresa was not her real name. Her childhood name was Agnes. She was a woman who was born with love and compassion in her heart. From childhood, Agnes' heart was filled with immense compassion. She was too pious from an early age and committed to charity. 
She got such great values from her mother. Agnes and her mother helped others as far as possible and also they always prayed for the others. Dranafile regularly helped others by giving them food, clothes, and other essential items.
                 </p>
  <br>    
                <li><strong> Agnes became Teresa </strong> </li>
                <p>When Agnes reached India, then her training to be a Nun had started. The training to be a Nun has three stages:</p>
                  <p> The first stage is Novices. On May 23, 1929, Agnes became an official novice, which is the beginner phase. Where she trained to help others.</p>

                  <p> The second stage is Postulant. This is the religious phase of the training period.</p>

                  <p> The third and final stage is Nun. In the process of becoming a Nun, they all had the choice to take a new name.
                      So Agnes took the name of 'Teresa'. So this is how Agnes of Skopje became Sister Teresa of India. </p>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Teresa as a Teacher</strong> </li>
 		    <p>In 1931, Teresa took her first vow of Celibacy. Teresa's institution sent her to Darjeeling where she taught in a convent school. She taught Arithmetic, Geography, and Religion.
                   Mother Teresa had faced many challenges after coming to India. She didn't know English. So firstly, she learned English and Hindi both languages. Along with all this, she continued to help needy people.
                   After a month, Teresa transferred to Calcutta (now known as Kolkata) from Darjeeling. And Nowshe started to teach in St. Mary High School.</p>
                <br>

                <p> Teresa called herself the Mother of the poor, needy, refugees, slums, disabled and unwanted people. She also not only provided food and shelter for the AIDS patients, but also she gave them social acceptance and healed them with her compassion. She was with all those people, who didn't have anyone in this world and who were a burden for society.
                  By healing all the needy, she became Sister Teresa to Mother Teresa.</p>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Foundation of Missionaries of Charity</strong> </li>

                   And she opened the branches of missionaries of charity globally.</p>

                <p>In 1950, Teresa and other Missionaries got official permission to start their own charitable homes. Finally, on 7 October 1950,
                   Teresa established <strong>'Missionaries of Charity' </strong>in Calcutta.</p>

                <p>Teresa had opened so many Missionary Institutions, not only in Indiabut across the globe. Most of the findings for Missionary

                   the AIDS and HIV sufferers in Europe and America. And also took care of people who were the victim of <strong>NaturalDisasters </strong> such as floods, epidemics, etc.</p>
